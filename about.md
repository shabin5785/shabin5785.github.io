A native of Gods own Country, India, I am a software enthusiast interested in latest technologies. The technologies that i am familiar with include **Core Java, J2ee, Spring Framework,C,PHP, Apache Storm, Javascript, Jquery, NodeJs, Angular, MongoDB, MySQL**. I am really interested in learnig languages/technologies like **Docker, Chef, AWS, React and Python.**
Most of the above languages are self-taught. I am trying to contribute more to open source, learn new design methodologies and to read books that help me grow as a developer. It must be said that Hacker News and Reddit are two of my greatest sources of information. (Found about Jekyll and how to blog in GitHub from HN).

My primary idea for this blog is to share my knowledge with others. I am a great believer in a tutorial/blog that explains the idea in simple language with easy to understand and real world examples.


### More Information

Initial parts of my career was full of coding and not appreciating or understanding the full meaning of what I was doing.  Over the years, ( I have 8 years of experience), I have realized that true knowledge lies in understanding the core concept and then implementing that. Been on that quest ever since. I donâ€™t do free-lance as of now, but plan to take up  in future. In my free time, I watch football ( Been a Manchester United fan my whole life), work out in gym, watch movies or tv series, read books( mainly crime and thrillers) and play with my niece.
